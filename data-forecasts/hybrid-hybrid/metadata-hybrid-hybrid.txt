team_model_designation: primary
methods: Negative Binomial base prediction with Functional Linear Modeling approach for Great Plains, custom model for Chicago area starting in July, and a Bayesian EAKF for selected locations nationwide starting in July.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: April Forecast: Historical human cases, lagged precipitation, temperature, Standardized Precipitation Index, and Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index. 
methods_long: April Forecast: A Negative Binomial model was fit to every county in the US. Functional Linear Modeling was used for Great Plains counties from the following states: Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, Minnesota, Colorado, and Wyoming. Only counties where the FLM approach had a lower Continous Ranked Probability Score on average  compared to the Negative Binomial Model were included. In these cases, they replaced the Negative Binomial model predictions. Once additional data sources become available, additional models will be selectively added to the forecasts.
